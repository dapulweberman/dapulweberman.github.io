<b>GREETINGS</b>. My name is Sarah Dapul-Weberman. I used to work at <a href="https://pinterest.com/sarahddubs" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> as a software engineer doing web performance. Because of this, I have decided to boycott anything that would make my site run slowly.  I have already saved you several precious milliseconds. You are welcome.
<br><br>
<b>After almost four years as a software engineer at Pinterest, I am currently taking time off to work on my own projects.
	I am unlikely to respond to recruiting emails for SWE positions until <i>at least</i> January 2019.
	If you have something other than SWE that you think I might be interested in, please feel free to email me.
	</b>
<br><br>

Before Pinterest, I was a computer science student at Stanford. I'm passionate about the future of tech, gender studies, and a whole ton of other things.
