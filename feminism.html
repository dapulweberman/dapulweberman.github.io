		What this is really about is men accusing feminists of sexism and hypocrisy unless they can prove that they spend exactly half of their time, energy, and resources on campaigning on behalf of men. What this is really about is that if feminism only improves the lives of women, it has no value or importance. What this is really about is that feminism only has value if it works on behalf of men and improves the lives of men. What this is really about is anti-feminist men being threatened by women working for women. What they're really saying is that to talk about women, to focus on women, to point out that something affects women badly; all of this is of no importance or value. It's classic, really - because men are not always the focus of attention of feminism, these anti-feminists can't stand it.
		<br><br>
		What this is about is that some men can't stand not being the center of attention.
		<br><br>
		<strong>I'm sick to the back teeth, sick and tired, of feminists being accused of sexism and hypocrisy unless we spend exactly half of our time and resources pointing out every instance of how 'patriarchy hurts men too'.</strong> Gay rights activists aren't expected to spend half their time campaigning for heterosexuals. Anti-racism activists aren't expected to spend ages campaigning on behalf of white people. Yet its a different story with feminism, isn't it? <strong>The most infuriating thing about this is that I do think that feminism is important for men as well as women and I encourage both men and women to critique mainstream masculinity as well as femininity. But that doesn't mean that I think that every single instance of feminist activism has to be prefaced with a disclaimer about how this also benefits men.</strong> Frankly, I'm getting a little bored of it. I believe it strongly, but there's only so many times I am forced to repeat it before it gets a little wearing and I start to wonder why I have to keep doing it in the first place.
		<br><br>
		Yet sadly, this "improving women's lives is sexist" attitude reflects part of the wider mainstream fear of feminism. <strong>It's why people say things like 'I'm not a feminist, I'm a humanist' or 'I'm not a feminist, I'm in favour of human rights'. It's because there is a stigma attached to any activism that unashamedly benefits women, as a social group. It's not seen as worthy enough, and fighting on behalf of women as a group is embarassing somehow. </strong> I'm just talking about plain, uncontroversial activism that improves the lives of women.

		"Being born a woman is an awful tragedy. Yes, my consuming desire to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, bar room regulars-to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording-all is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yet, God, I want to talk to everybody I can as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night."<br>

		"Feminism has fought no wars. It has killed no opponents. It has set up no concentration camps, starved no enemies, practiced no cruelties. Its battles have been for education, for the vote, for better working conditions, for safety in the streets, for child care, for social welfare, for rape crisis centres, women's refuges, reforms in the law. If someone says, 'Oh, I'm not a feminist', I ask, 'Why? What's your problem?'"

		It saddens me to see girls proudly declaring they're not like other girls - especially when it's 41,000 girls saying it in a chorus, never recognizing the contradiction.
		It's taking a form of contempt for women - even a hatred for women- and internalizing it by saying, Yes, those girls are awful, but I'm special, I'm not like that, instead of stepping back and saying, This is a lie.
		<strong>The real meaning of "I'm not like the other girls" is "I'm not the media's image of what girls should be." </strong>
		Well, very, very few of us are.
		Pop culture wants to tell us that we're all shallow, backstabbing, appearance-obsessed shopaholics without a thought in our heads beyond cute boys and cuter handbags.
		<strong>It's a lie - a flat-out lie - and we need to recognize it and say so instead of accepting that judgment as true for other girls, but not for you.</strong>

		Fashion is one of the very few forms of expression in which women have more freedom than men.
		And I don't think it's an accident that it's typically seen as shallow, trivial, and vain.
		It is the height of irony that women are valued for our looks, encouraged to make ourselves beautiful and ornamental...
		and are then derided as shallow and vain for doing so.
		And it's a subtle but definite form of sexism to take one of the few forms of expression where women have more freedom, and treat it as a form of expression that's inherently superficial and trivial.
		Like it or not, fashion and style are primarily a women's art form.
		And I think it gets treated as trivial because women get treated as trivial.

		<strong>Feminism is not about who opens the jar. </strong>
		<br><br>
		<strong>It is not about who pays for the date.</strong> It is not about who moves the couch. It is not about who kills the bugs. It is not about who cooks the dinner. It's not even about who stays home with the kids, as long as the decision was made together, after thinking carefully about your situation and coming to an agreement that makes sense for your particular marriage and family. 
		<br><br>
		<strong>It is about making sure that nobody ever has to do anything by "default" because of their gender.</strong> The stronger person should move the couch. The person who enjoys cooking more, has more time for it, and/or is better at it should do the cooking. Sometimes the stronger person is male, sometimes not. Sometimes the person who is best suited for cooking is female, sometimes not. You should do what works. 
		<br><br>
		But it is also about letting people know that it is okay to change. If you're a woman who wants to become stronger, that's great. If you're a man who wants to learn how to cook, that's also great. You might start out with a relationship where the guy opens all the jars and the girl cooks all the meals, but you might find that you want to try something else. So try it.

		One of the worst ways to stop someone from telling sexist jokes is to tell him the joke isn't funny. He'll assume that you're humorless and that he needs to save the good stuff for the right audience. If you really want someone to stop telling sexist jokes, you need to tell him, "I don't get it" and then step back as he tries not to say, "It's funny because women are stupid."

		<div class="heading">Homophobia: The fear that another man will treat you like you treat women.</div>
	    We were discussing homosexuality because of an allusion to it in the book we were reading, and several boys made comments such as, "That's disgusting." We got into the debate and eventually a boy admitted that he was terrified/disgusted when he was once sharing a taxi and the other male passenger made a pass at him.
	    <br>
	    The lightbulb went off. "Oh," I said. "I get it. See, you are afraid, because for the first time in your life you have found yourself a victim of unwanted sexual advances by someone who has the physical ability to use force against you." The boy nodded and shuddered visibly.
	    <br>
	    "But," I continued. "As a woman, you learn to live with that from the time you are fourteen, and it never stops. We live with that fear every day of our lives. Every man walking through the parking garage the same time you are is either just a harmless stranger or a potential rapist. Every time."
	    <br>
	    The girls in the room nodded, agreeing. The boys seemed genuinely shocked. 
	    <br>
	    So think about that the next time you hit on a girl. Maybe, like you in the taxi, she doesn't actually want you to.

		There are the occasions that men- intellectual men, clever men, engaged men- insist on playing devil's advocate, desirous of a debate on some aspect of feminist theory or reproductive rights or some other subject generally filed under the heading: Women's Issues. These intellectual, clever, engaged men want to endlessly probe my argument for weaknesses, want to wrestle over details, want to argue just for fun- and they wonder, these intellectual, clever, engaged men, why my voice keeps raising and why my face is flushed and why, after an hour of fighting my corner, hot tears burn the corners of my eyes.

		"Women are expected to be nice and sweet, to make other people feel comfortable. A woman who says 'hey, I think there's a problem here' is being 'negative.' A woman who doesn't smile while she's being harassed is 'humourless.' A woman who prefers to stay focused on tasks is a 'cold bitch.' Significant gendering is involved here; women have an obligation to look and act a certain way and when they don't, they need to be hassled until they do.'"

	<div class="itemQuote mediumquote">"Men's rights activists don't organize marches; they don't build shelters or raise funds for abused men; they don't organize prostate cancer-awareness events or campaign against prison rape. What they actually do, when they're not simply carping in comments online, is target and harass women- from feminist writers and professors to activists- in an attempt to silence them."

		"If you require any evidence that femininity can be more fierce and dangerous than masculinity, all you need to do is ask the average man to hold your handbag or a bouquet of flowers for a minute, and watch how far away he holds it from his body. Or tell him that you would like to put your lipstick on him and watch how fast he runs off in the other direction."

		I'm not a misandrist, but a few quick questions:
		<br><br>
		If men can't even make their own sandwiches, why are they allowed to make bills in congress?
		<br><br>
		If men can't control their own sexual urges, why are they allowed to control nations?
		<br><br>
		If a woman's legs/shoulders are enough to distract a man, how can we trust them to stay focused on things like open heart surgery or judging a murder trial?
		<br><br>
		Again not a misandrist, some of my best friends are guys and i'm even dating one.

		The thing about micro aggressions is that eventually you have enough of it<br><br>

		And you end up blowing up<br><br>

		And people look at you funny like "why are you so angry it's just spilled milk"<br><br>

		Ok but you always spilling milk on me tho

		"Too many young girls don't know how to act when someone's being inappropriate with them. They giggle or they try to brush it off. Don't do that. Tell them to go fuck themselves - be a bitch. If someone's being disrespectful to you, be disrespectful right back. Show them the same amount of respect that they show you."
